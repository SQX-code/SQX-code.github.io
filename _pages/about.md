I am currently a fourth year undergraduate student from [School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering](https://dept3.buaa.edu.cn/), [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/). My research interest includes robot manipulation, multi-agent system and embodied AI. The ultimate goal of my research is to develop and control a robotic system that can perceive, reason, act, and smartly collaborate with each other.
